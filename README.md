# Frontend Assessment

## How to bring the app up locally
- Application is ran on expo, so after cloning the repository:
    -  __npm install__
    
    - __Mobile:__
        -
        -  __npm start__
            - then scan the QR to open the application in Expo on your mobile device
    - __Desktop:__
        -
        - __npm start__
            - 'a' to open in android simulator
            - 'i' to open in ios simulator
            - 'w' to open in web
        
            
    
             

## Assumptions made
- Filtering
    - Filter options change dynamically based on retrieved data
    - i.e. - If Make chosen was honda, only honda options would be allowed for selection, same goes for color, however did not implement year
- Car Cards
    - Included the essential information:
        - Car Make
        - Car Model
        - Car Year
        - Price per day
    - Styled them in dark mode and attempted to match the color scheme I though best fit
